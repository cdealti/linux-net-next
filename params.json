{"name":"Linux-net-next","tagline":"Friendly fork of the Linux net-next branch with additional patches for the 6LoWPAN stack","body":"Unofficial patch set(s) for the Linux Wireless Sensor Network project\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\nWhat is this project?\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide the latest bugfixes on both the [IEEE 802.15.4][ieee802154] and\r\nthe [6LoWPAN][] stacks within the Linux Kernel to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nOn the long term, these patches should be incorporated to the *net-next* branch\r\nof the Linux kernel. This page aims to regroup all of them, and provide them a\r\nbigger exposure, for more extensive reviews.\r\n\r\nWhy does this project exists?\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile an fair number of very motivated persons work on the Linux [IEEE\r\n802.15.4][ieee802154] and [6LoWPAN] stacks, most of them have very little time to actually push\r\ntheir work to the *net-next* branch of the Linux kernel for inclusion, or seek\r\nfor more review before they do so.\r\nConsequently, a newcomer to the project will spend a lot of time figuring out\r\nwhere the most recent work is located, because it is scattered in so many places.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to tackle this particular issue, and to make it easier to\r\nnewcomers to have a recent and functional version of the kernel, benefiting\r\nfrom the latest bugfixes.\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn order to retrieve a recent version of the net-next branch of the Linux\r\nkernel and apply the patches on top of it, you need to perform the two\r\nfollowing step:\r\n* clone this repository\r\n* checkout the branch your interested in (e.g. *git checkout 6lowpan*)\r\n\r\nHow to contribute\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe proper way to get your patches reviewed is to send them to the Linux Zigbee\r\nmailing list (<linux-zigbee-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>). You can find more on\r\nthe list (including the archives) [here](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-zigbee-devel).\r\n\r\nIf I see your patch(es) on the lists and find it sensible (yes, that's highly suggestive), I will include it in the sets here.\r\nHowever if I fail to notice your patch, you can either send me a pull request, or your patches directly.\r\n\r\nExternal links\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* [Linux Zigbee](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/linux-zigbee/): home of the old (now deprecated) implementation.
